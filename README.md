# Swiss Public Transport Departure Chrome Extension
This extension alerts users when a train, tram or bus departs from a station. 

The user pre-selects the departure station, the time range in which the notification should be displayed and the number of minutes prior to the departure when the alert should be displayed. Transport data is retrieved and processed every minute from <a href="https://transport.opendata.ch/">https://transport.opendata.ch</a>. Please note that the author of this extension is not responsible if you miss your public transportation.
